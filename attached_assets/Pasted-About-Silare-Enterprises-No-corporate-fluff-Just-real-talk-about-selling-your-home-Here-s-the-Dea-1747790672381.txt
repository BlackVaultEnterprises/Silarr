About Silare Enterprises
No corporate fluff. Just real talk about selling your home.

Here’s the Deal
Look, selling a house sucks. Inspections, realtors, waiting months just to get lowballed? We’ve seen it all. Spencer (that’s me) started Silare because I got tired of watching my York neighbors get nickel-and-dimed by big “We Buy Houses” chains that don’t give a damn about our community.

This isn’t a sales pitch. If you want to sell fast, great. If not? We’ll still tell you exactly what your options are. No pressure, no tricks.

Why People Actually Choose Us
(Straight from our clients)

1️⃣ “You answered your damn phone.”
— Mike, Spring Grove
Most companies make you talk to a call center. Text/call Spencer directly: *(717) XXX-XXXX*. We’re local. We pick up.

2️⃣ “You didn’t care that my basement looked like a zombie movie set.”
— Sarah, Dover
No judging your clutter, repairs, or that weird wallpaper your grandma installed in 1987. We buy houses as-is. Always.

3️⃣ “You let me stay an extra month so my kids could finish school.”
— James, Red Lion
Big corporations want you out yesterday. We work around your timeline.

How This Works
You tell us about your house (5 minutes, no commitments).

We give you a cash offer within 24 hours.

You decide. Close in 7 days, 7 months, or never. Zero pressure.

No “Psychology,” Just Honesty
We don’t do:

Fake urgency (“OFFER EXPIRES TONIGHT!”)

Bait-and-switch pricing

Scripted “empathy” from hired actors

We do:

Show you comps so you know our offer’s fair

Let you keep the washer/dryer (seriously, take it)

Recommend other options if we’re not the best fit

Meet Spencer
York born, York bored, York built.
I’ve rebuilt 19 homes here since 2023. My mom still lives in the house I grew up in off Roosevelt Ave. I’m not a saint—just a guy who thinks you deserve better than sleezy investor tactics.

Text me direct: *(717) XXX-XXXX*
No bots. No assistants. Just me and my coffee addiction.

P.S. If a competitor beats our offer, forward it. We’ll buy you a case of Lionshead while you think it over.
