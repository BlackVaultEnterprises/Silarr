About Silar Enterprises

Selling a house can be a pain. Inspections, realtors, waiting months just to get lowballed? We’ve seen it all. We started Silar Enterprises because we got tired of watching our York neighbors get nickel-and-dimed by big “We Buy Houses” chains that don’t give a damn about our community.

This isn’t a sales pitch. If you want to sell fast, great. If not? We’ll still tell you exactly what your options are. No pressure, no gimmicks.

Why People Actually Choose Us
(Straight from our clients)

 “You answered your damn phone.”

Most companies make you talk to a call center. Text/call Spencer directly: (717) 858-8338. We’re local. We pick up.

“You didn’t care that my basement looked like a zombie movie set.”
— Sarah, Dover
No judging your clutter, repairs, or that weird wallpaper your grandma installed in 1987. We buy houses as-is, no inspection needed in as little as 7 days. Always.

“You let me stay an extra month so my kids could finish school.”

Big corporations want you out yesterday. We work around your timeline to make the moving process as smooth and convenient as possible.

Meet Spencer
York born and built.
I’ve rebuilt 19 homes here since 2023. My mom still lives in the house I grew up in off Leader Heights Rd. I’m not a saint—just a guy who thinks you deserve better than sleezy investor tactics.

No bots. No assistants. Just me and my coffee addiction.

P.S. If a competitor beats our offer, forward it. We may just buy you a case of Lionshead while you think it over.
